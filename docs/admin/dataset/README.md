## Introduction
At a high level, Leaf aims to do two things:

1) Identify cohorts of patients (using [Concepts](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/admin/concept/README.md)).
2) Extract data for those patients.

After users identify a Cohort in (1), they can next do (2), which we'll explain here. In Leaf, extracted data for a cohort are called "datasets", which is short-hand for `Patient List Datasets`. This refers to the row-level patient data you can see on the `Patient List` screen.

Each dataset is based on templates, or denormalized tabular representations of [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html). In order to add datasets, administrators can define SQL queries whose column names and types match a given template. 

**Note that we also have an existing issue to add dynamic datasets which would allow admins to define completely custom datasets with arbitrary columns https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/issues/95. If you think these would be helpful to you please comment and add your thoughts.**

### Basic Demographics
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/admin/images/dataset_intro.gif"/></p>

The core dataset Leaf uses is `Basic Demographics`. The output of this query is used to both populate the initial `Patient List` screen, as well as populate the bar charts on the `Visualize` screen.

The fields in `Basic Demographics` represent a denormalized combination of the FHIR [Person](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/person.html) and [Patient](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) resources.

The expected columns are:

| Name              | Type      | 
| ----------------- | --------- |
| personId          | nvarchar  |
| addressPostalCode | nvarchar  |
| addressState      | nvarchar  |
| birthDate         | datetime  |
| deceasedDateTime  | datetime  |
| ethnicity         | nvarchar  |
| gender            | nvarchar  |
| deceasedBoolean   | bit       |
| hispanicBoolean   | bit       |
| marriedBoolean    | bit       |
| language          | nvarchar  |
| maritalStatus     | nvarchar  |
| mrn               | nvarchar  |
| name              | nvarchar  |
| race              | nvarchar  |
| religion          | nvarchar  |

### Key Points
- **All columns in `Basic Demongraphics` are required** - Leaf will automatically date-shift, calculate ages, and remove the HIPAA identified columns (`mrn` and `name`) depending on if the user is in `Identified` or `De-identified` mode.

- **The Patient Identifier column must be called *personId*** - While Leaf Concepts are flexible regarding the [column name for patient identifiers](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/deploy/app/README.md#fieldpersonid), datasets are more restrictive and require a predictable, specific column name. This ensures alignment of Leaf datasets when multiple Leaf instances are federated, among other reasons.

- **It's okay if you don't have data for every column** - Though every column must be returned in the SQL statement, it's fine to hard-code it as 'Unknown', etc. For example, `religion = 'Unknown'`.

- **The `isDeceased`, `isHispanic`, and `isMarried` bit/boolean columns are used in the bar charts on the `Visualize` screen** - These are needed because Leaf does not enforce specific values for the `ethnicity` or `maritalStatus` columns (so you have flexiblity in showing your data as it is), but in return you need to define these true/false columns yourself. For example, `hispanicBoolean = CAST(CASE ethnicity WHEN 'Hispanic or Latino' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS BIT)`.

- **Values in `gender` must be `F`, `Female`, `M`, or `Male`** - This allows them to be predictably aggregated in bar charts (case insensitive).

### Defining the Basic Demographics Query
Currently the Basic Demographics query (and other datasets) must be added via SQL directly to the database, though we intend to create functionality in the `Admin` screen to make this easier in the future.

1) Define a query in SQL that returns the columns defined above. Here is how we configure the [CMS SynPuf OMOP dataset](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF.html) demographics query, for example:

```sql
SELECT 
    personId = CAST(p.person_id AS NVARCHAR)
  , addressPostalCode = l.zip
  , addressState = p.location_state
  , birthDate = p.birth_datetime
  , deceasedDateTime = p.death_date
  , ethnicity = p.ethnicity
  , gender = CASE WHEN p.gender = 'F' THEN 'female' WHEN p.gender = 'M' THEN 'male' ELSE 'other' END
  , [language] = 'Unknown'
  , maritalStatus = 'Unknown'
  , marriedBoolean = CAST(0 AS BIT)
  , hispanicBoolean = CAST(CASE WHEN p.ethnicity_code = 38003563 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS BIT)
  , deceasedBoolean = CAST(CASE WHEN p.death_date IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS BIT)
  , [name] = 'Unknown Unknown'
  , mrn = 'Unknown'
  , race = p.race
  , religion = 'Unknown'
FROM v_person p 
     LEFT JOIN [location] l ON p.location_id = l.location_id
```

2) INSERT the query into the `app.DemographicQuery` table.

Using the above example:

```sql
DECLARE @shape INT = 3
DECLARE @query NVARCHAR(MAX) = 
'SELECT 
    personId = CAST(p.person_id AS NVARCHAR)
  , addressPostalCode = l.zip
  , addressState = p.location_state
  , birthDate = p.birth_datetime
  , deceasedDateTime = p.death_date
  , ethnicity = p.ethnicity
  , gender = CASE WHEN p.gender = ''F'' THEN ''female'' 
                  WHEN p.gender = ''M'' THEN ''male'' 
                  ELSE ''other'' 
             END
  , [language] = ''Unknown''
  , maritalStatus = ''Unknown''
  , marriedBoolean = CAST(0 AS BIT)
  , hispanicBoolean = CAST(CASE WHEN p.ethnicity_code = 38003563 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS BIT)
  , deceasedBoolean = CAST(CASE WHEN p.death_date IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS BIT)
  , [name] = ''Unknown Unknown''
  , mrn = ''Unknown'' 
  , race = p.race
  , religion = ''Unknown''
FROM v_person p 
     LEFT JOIN [location] l ON p.location_id = l.location_id'

INSERT INTO [app].[DemographicQuery] ([Lock], [SqlStatement], [Shape], [LastChanged], [ChangedBy]) 
VALUES 
(   
    'X'
  , @query
  , @shape
  , GETDATE()
  , '<my_user_name>'
)
```

Note that the `Shape` field in Leaf happens to be value `3`, so it needs to be hard-coded here.

## Adding New Datasets
If you've successfully added the `Basic Demographics` dataset and can see data returned in the `Patient List` screen in the Leaf user interface, you're off to a great start. Inevitably though you'll likely want to allow users to add more datasets beyond demographics.

To do so, we'll need to add rows in the [app.DatasetQuery](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/app.DatasetQuery.Table.sql) table in the Leaf application database.

Let's start with an example. In this case, we'll add a [Platelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet) dataset which will represent platelet count laboratory tests.

### Create a Dataset Category
To begin, we need to decide how best to visually organize the platelets dataset, specifically whether to place it under a category or not. Visually this would look like:

**Under a 'Labs' Category**
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/admin/images/dataset_category.png"/></p>

**Uncategorized**
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/admin/images/dataset_nocategory.png"/></p>

In most cases, we recommend categorizing datasets to provide context to users, particularly as your datasets grow in number. To add a category, simply insert a row into the [app.DatasetQueryCategory](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/app.DatasetQueryCategory.Table.sql) table. You'll use the `Id` created as a foreign key to the `app.DatasetQuery` `CategoryId` field.

```sql
INSERT INTO [app].[DatasetQueryCategory] (Category, Created)
SELECT 'Labs', GETDATE()

SELECT Id, Category
FROM [app].[DatasetQueryCategory]
```
Output:

| Id  | Category |
| --- | -------- |
| 1   | Labs     |

### Determine the Template and Query
Next, we'll determine which dataset template is the best fit for this new dataset by checking the [Dataset Templates Reference](#dataset-templates-reference) below. In FHIR labs are generally represented as [Observations](#observation), so let's use that.

For demonstrative purposes we'll use data from the [MIMIC Critical Care Database](https://mimic.physionet.org/), but the methods here can be applied to other data models as well.

Let's suppose we have a SQL table or view representing labs (including platelets) called `dbo.v_LABEVENTS` that looks like this:

| SUBJECT_ID | HADM_ID | LABEL          | LOINC_CODE | CHARTIME   | VALUE | VALUENUM | VALUEUOM |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | -------- |
| 1          | 100     | Platelet Count | 777-3      | 2101-10-04 | 301   | 301      | K/uL     |      
| 1          | 200     | Platelet Count | 777-3      | 2101-02-10 | 192   | 192      | K/uL     | 
| 2          | 300     | Platelet Count | 777-3      | 2101-12-22 | 533   | 533      | K/uL     |

To output a SQL set satisfying the [Observation](#observation) template columns, we may use:

```sql
SELECT 
    personId      = CAST(SUBJECT_ID AS NVARCHAR)
  , encounterId   = CAST(HADM_ID AS NVARCHAR)
  , category      = 'lab'
  , code          = LOINC_CODE
  , effectiveDate = CHARTTIME
  , valueString   = VALUE
  , valueQuantity = VALUENUM
  , valueUnit     = VALUEUOM
FROM [dbo].[v_LABEVENTS]
WHERE LABEL = 'Platelet Count'
```

Which would output:

| personId   | encounterId | category | code  | effectiveDate   | valueString | valueQuantity | valueUnit |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1          | 100         | lab      | 777-3 | 2101-10-04      | 301         | 301           | K/uL      |      
| 1          | 200         | lab      | 777-3 | 2101-02-10      | 192         | 192           | K/uL      | 
| 2          | 300         | lab      | 777-3 | 2101-12-22      | 533         | 533           | K/uL      |

### Insert the dataset
Next, we need to insert a row into the `app.DatasetQuery` table:

```sql
DECLARE @categoryId INT      = 1
DECLARE @shape INT           = 1  -- Observation dataset shape id
DECLARE @query NVARCHAR(MAX) = 
'SELECT 
    personId      = CAST(SUBJECT_ID AS NVARCHAR)
  , encounterId   = CAST(HADM_ID AS NVARCHAR)
  , category      = ''lab''
  , code          = LOINC_CODE
  , effectiveDate = CHARTTIME
  , valueString   = VALUE
  , valueQuantity = VALUENUM
  , valueUnit     = VALUEUOM
FROM [dbo].[v_LABEVENTS]
WHERE LABEL = ''Platelet Count'''

INSERT INTO [app].[DatasetQuery] ([Shape],[Name],[CategoryId],[SqlStatement],
                                  [Created],[CreatedBy],[Updated],[UpdatedBy])
SELECT 
    @shape
  , 'Platelet Count'
  , @categoryId
  , @query
  , GETDATE()
  , '<my_user_name>'
  , GETDATE()
  , '<my_user_name>'
```

### Test
Finally, let's test to see if the dataset works. In the Leaf client app, run a query for a cohort which you know to have platelet lab values. In the `Patient List`, select the new dataset.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/admin/images/dataset_add.gif"/></p>

If you're able to navigate to the `Patient List` and add the new dataset, congratulations! Leaf automatically determines that this is a numeric dataset because the `valueQuantity` field is populated, and computes statistics for each patient.

## Dataset Templates Reference
As mentioned in the [Introduction](#introduction), datasets are denormalized, tabular representations of [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html).

> Note: SQL Columns of type `numeric` listed below can be `INT`, `FLOAT`, `MONEY`, `NUMERIC`, `REAL`, `SMALLINT`, `SMALLMONEY`, or `DECIMAL`.

## Observation
*Dataset Shape **1*** - A representation of the [FHIR Observation Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html).

The FHIR documention suggests using this resource for:
> - Vital signs such as body weight, blood pressure, and temperature
> - Laboratory Data like blood glucose, or an estimated GFR
> - Imaging results like bone density or fetal measurements
> - Clinical Findings such as abdominal tenderness
> - Device measurements such as EKG data or Pulse Oximetry data
> - Clinical assessment tools such as APGAR or a Glasgow Coma Score
> - Personal characteristics: such as eye-color
> - Social history like tobacco use, family support, or cognitive status
> - Core characteristics like pregnancy status, or a death assertion

## Condition
*Dataset Shape **4*** - A representation of the [FHIR Condition Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html).

The FHIR documention describes this as (emphasis added):
> This resource is used to record detailed information about a **condition, problem, diagnosis**, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern. The condition could be a point in time diagnosis in context of an encounter, it could be an item on the practitioner’s Problem List, or it could be a concern that doesn’t exist on the practitioner’s Problem List. Often times, a condition is about a clinician's assessment and assertion of a particular aspect of a patient's state of health. It can be used to record information about a disease/illness identified from application of clinical reasoning over the pathologic and pathophysiologic findings (diagnosis), or identification of health issues/situations that a practitioner considers harmful, potentially harmful and may be investigated and managed (problem), or other health issue/situation that may require ongoing monitoring and/or management (health issue/concern).

The FHIR documention describes this as:
> This resource is used to record the details of current and historical procedures performed on or for a patient. A procedure is an activity that is performed on, with, or for a patient as part of the provision of care. Examples include surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, counseling, physiotherapy, personal support services, adult day care services, non-emergency transportation, home modification, exercise, etc. Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a service provider, a friend or relative or in some cases by the patient themselves.

## MedicationRequest
*Dataset Shape **8*** - A representation of the [FHIR MedicationRequest Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest.html).

The FHIR documention describes this as (emphasis added):
> This resource covers **all type of orders for medications for a patient**. This includes inpatient medication orders as well as community orders (whether filled by the prescriber or by a pharmacy). It also includes orders for over-the-counter medications (e.g. Aspirin), total parenteral nutrition and diet/ vitamin supplements. It may be used to support the order of medication-related devices. It is not intended for use in prescribing particular diets, or for ordering non-medication-related items (eyeglasses, supplies, etc.). In addition, the MedicationRequest may be used to report orders/request from external systems that have been reported for informational purposes and are not authoritative and are not expected to be acted upon (e.g. dispensed or administered).

## MedicationAdministration
*Dataset Shape **9*** - A representation of the [FHIR MedicationAdministration Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationadministration.html).

The FHIR documention describes this as:
> This resource covers the administration of all medications and vaccines. Please refer to the Immunization Resource/Profile for the treatment of vaccines. It will principally be used within care settings (including inpatient) to record the capture of medication administrations, including self-administrations of oral medications, injections, intra-venous adjustments, etc. It can also be used in outpatient settings to record allergy shots and other non-immunization administrations. In some cases, it might be used for home-health reporting, such as recording self-administered or even device-administered insulin.
